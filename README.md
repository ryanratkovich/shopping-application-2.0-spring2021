# shopping-application-2.0-spring2021

This application serves as an enhanced version of my previous console-based shopping application. This version is a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application that provides the user with a UI to accomplish shopping for and checking out products from a store. This application utilizes the same OOP heirarchy found in the previous console-based version with some notable changes overall:
  - Responsive UI via XAML markup 
  - Utilizes MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to separate Views (UI) from Models (state) via ViewModels (business logic) for increased scalability
  - Demonstrates the use of multiple .NET UWP classes as well as general UWP topics (ListView, TextBox, Button, Click Events, Data Binding, etc.)
  - Utilizes Newtonsoft.json (Json.NET) to provide serialization/de-serialization functionality to save state to user's local machine
